      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I have been with Fidelity Investments since 2012 and worked in a variety
        of roles in that time. Starting in Outbound Mail Operations, followed by UAT testing for the Money Movement team within FI, and finally
        coming over to the Talent and Learning Group within FI as a Senior Facilitator.
        In this space I help to build, prepare, deliver and evaluate both
        in person and virtual training sessions for associates in the FI/FBOT business</p>
